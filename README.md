# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## New features
* Enter player's name at the beginning and stored player's data, including name and score, in the file scoreboard.txt
* Pause game when pressing ESC button, after that select 1 of 2 options: resume or exit

## Satified Requirements
1. Loop, Functions, I/O
* The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
  * The project code is clearly organized into functions: All the added methods is written as functions
* The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.
  * Project handles player's data and stores at in file scoreboard.txt
* The project accepts user input and processes the input.
  * User enters player's name.
2. Object Oriented Programming
* The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
  * Class Player represents for player object
* Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
  * Create some set/get functions. For example: SetGameState(), GetCurrentState()
* Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
  * In class Player's constructor, initialize player name
  * In renderer.cpp:40, initialize sdl_texture
3. Memory Management
* The project makes use of references in function declarations.
  * In controller.cpp:15, pass game's reference to HandleInput()
